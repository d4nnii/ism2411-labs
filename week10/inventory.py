# Reflection Questions:
# 1: The most surprising about lists in Python is how easy it is to change them by adding, removing, or sorting the items. I also learned that negative indexing lets you access items from the end of a list.
# 2: In a business class, Python lists could help me organize data and calculate totals and averages for things like sales without doing everything manually in Excel. It would save me time, especially when working with a big amount of data or comparing sales from different months, etc.
